## About the project

Toquen el DOM ("Play the DOM") is the interactive website for Escola de Música Benimaclet, a music school with over 35 years of history in Valencia, Spain. This project blends the school’s educational ethos with a playful experience: a virtual piano that users can play directly in their browser, using either their mouse or computer keyboard.

The website acts as a showcase for the school, highlighting its legacy and academic programs, while inviting visitors of all ages to explore music in an intuitive way. Perfect for prospective students, families, or music enthusiasts, it combines accessible design, interactivity, and a passion for music education
